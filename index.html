        <p>My name is Rick Barbour and I have been a resident of Houston, TX for the past 10 years along with my wife and 
          two young kids. I received a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute 
          in 2006 and have been working in the oil and gas industry ever since. I started out as a field engineer with 
          Schlumberger in Youngsville, Louisiana but since then my career has taken me all over the world including countries
          like England, Norway, Malaysia, Russia and China!</p>
        <p>I have always enjoyed making small programs in order to help make my job easier, and what initially started
          as a hobby has pivoted into my current role as a Senior Support Services Engineer with OneSubsea. I currently
          design and develop apps and BI reports using the Microsoft Power Platform. Since I started this role, I have
          been consistently looking to expand my programming knowledge which is why I have started taking the MERN Stack
          Certificate Course with MIT and created this digital portfolio as a result. </p>
